# Abstract
Trauma is one of the leading causes of death in India. Road traffic accidents cause about 60% of all traumatic brain injuries (TBI) in India. According to an estimate 50% of trauma deaths in India is caused by TBI.  The purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence, severity, cause, and outcome of admitted TBI patients.

## Method:
We will retrospectively analyse data from the Trauma Audit Filter Trial (TAFT). The data was collected from the tertiary care centre Seth Sukhlal Karnani Memorial Hospital (SSKM), Kolkata, West Bengal. The data collection period was October 2017 to January 2020. One project officer was appointed to collect data prospectively for eight hours per day in the emergency room. We included all patients who were 18 years or older and presented to the emergency department (ED) and was admitted for TBI.

A total of `r nrow(tbi)` TBI patients were admitted during the period of our study. `r n.male` (`r p.male`%) were male. Median age of patients was `r m.age` (quantile range: `r q1.age` to `r q3.age` & range: `r range.age`).Majority of the patients were within the age group 25-44 (Table no.1: `r table1`).Of all the TBI patients `r n.tran`(`r p.tran`%) were transferred from other hospitals. `r n.ambulance`(`r p.ambulance`%) patients were brought to SSKM via ambulance. There was median delay of `r m.delay`hrs (quantile range: `r q1.delay` to `r q3.delay`hrs, range: `r range.delay`hrs) from time of injury to arrival in hospital. Mean arterial pressure among TBI patients were `r m.ap` (quantile range: `r q1.ap` to `r q3.ap`; range: `r range.ap`).  Majority of the patients were within the GCS range 14-15 (Table no.2 : `r table2`) . A total of `r n.alert`(`r p.alert`%) were alert on presentation. Among the TBI patients admitted, `r n.surg` (`r p.surg`%) operative intervention was needed. Road traffic accident (RTA) accounts for majority of TBIs `r nm.moi.transport`(`r moi_transport`%) followed by fall `r nm.moi.fall`( `r moi_fall`%). Of all the RTAâ€™s, two wheeler accident consist of `r nm.moi.twowheelers`(`r moi_twowheelers`%). Mortality was `r n.death`(`r p.death`%) among these patients.  

## Conclusion
Road traffic accidents (RTA) is one of the main cause of TBI. Amoung RTA, two wheeler accidents (`r moi_twowheelers`%) were predominant. Majority of TBI patients were male (`r p.male`%). As SSKM is a tertiary care hospital majority of the patients were transferred (`r p.tran`%) from other hospitals.Therefore, median delay in arrival to the hospital is also high (`r m.delay`hrs).  Although `r p.alert`% were alert on presentation at the emergency department `r p.surg`% required operative intervention. Moratlity among the TBI patients was `r p.death`%.
